Personal portfolio website 

 Project Goal
The main goal of a Personal Portfolio Website is to:
Showcase your skills, projects, achievements, and experience in a professional and visually appealing manner.
Serve as a digital resume or online identity for networking, job applications, or freelance opportunities.
Allow visitors (like recruiters, clients, or collaborators) to learn more about you, view your work, and contact you easily.

Uses of the Project
Your personal portfolio website can be used for:
Job seeking: Highlighting your technical and creative abilities for potential employers.
Freelancing: Attracting clients by showcasing your past projects and services.
Brand building: Establishing a personal brand and online presence.
Networking: Sharing your website link in emails, social media, or business cards.
Learning: Gaining hands-on experience in frontend/backend development, UI/UX design, hosting, and deployment.

Significance of the Project
This project is significant because:
It is a practical application of web development skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, etc.).
Demonstrates self-motivation and the ability to create a real-world project from scratch.
Helps you stand out in a competitive field by showing employers or clients a dynamic and interactive profile rather than a static resume.
Encourages continuous improvement, as you can keep updating it with new projects and experiences.
